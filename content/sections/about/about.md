Hi, Iâ€™m Guy. I am in my second year of studying Maths and Computer Science at Durham University. I have a keen interest in problem-solving and I often find myself absorbed in fascinating <a href="/#projects"><u>projects.</u></a>

I am an active person and enjoy mountain-biking, running and gymnastics. When relaxing, I like to play the piano, code or play video games with my friends. I love programming with web technologies and have spent lots of time developing various projects such as this website.

I have also recently started tutoring and have been giving lessons to students studying for their school exams in Maths as well as teaching people how to code. <a href="/#contact"><u>Get in touch</u></a> if you'd like to learn more about this!
